# CE_framework
MESA inlists/extras, FLASH data, and analysis code to reproduce results of "The Energy Sharing Timescale in an Analytic Framework for Common Envelope Hydrodynamics" by Everson et al. (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241007036E">NASA/ADS</a>).

MESA <tt>inlists</tt> and <tt>run_star_extras.f</tt> are adapted from the MIST package of Choi et al. (2016) and Dotter (2016), available to download <a href="https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/data/tarballs_v1.0/MESA_files.tar.gz">here</a>. These files were developed for use with MESA v7503 (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015).

FLASH data is produced by a customized setup of FLASH v4.3 (Fryxell et al. 2000) used by Law-Smith et al. (2020), Hutchinson-Smith et al. (2024), and Everson et al. (2024).
